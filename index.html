				<h3>Halloween is our Specialty</h3>

				<p class="main">
					Here at Haunted Experiences we are here to give you a frightening good time. We do this by tailoring our approach and using our surroundings to make our attractions fun, but frightening! Our attractions include, but are not limited to haunted houses, mazes, escape rooms, and hay rides. In addition to this, we have a petting zoo and pumpkin painting for little ones. This means no matter what you're in to we have something for you and your family. Read below for more information!
				</p>

				<p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

				<h3>Bring your Friends</h3>


				<p class="main">
					Like all of us you probably have that one friend who "Doesn't get Scared" well with our haunted houses that is a thing of the past! Our attractions range from scary to downright spine chilling. Our haunted houses, hay rides, escape rooms and mazes will have different themes each week, but also two variations. On one hand, one variation of these attractions will be the mild normal scary that you might see at another haunted house. On the other hand, the other variation will be so scary you will need to sign a waiver before participating. So join in on the fun and lets test that friend that "Doesn't get Scared" together!
				</p>
				<p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>


				<h3>Bring your Family</h3>

				<p class="main">
					Want to come out and join in on the fun, but you feel that you can't because some Halloween attractions are to scary for the little ones? Not at haunted experiences! Here we have something for the whole family in Pumpkin Village. In Pumpkin Village we have pumpkin painting and carving as well as a petting zoo for the little ones. Furthermore, within pumpkin village we have Candy Trials which will allow your little ghouls to participate in the Halloween fun and win candy! So bring your family we guaruntee you will have a spooky good time.
